# Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC)

COSMIC is the leading resource for studying somatic mutations in human cancer. It defines [single base substitution (SBS) signatures](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/sbs/)—mutations where one nucleotide is replaced by another. To avoid redundancy, all substitutions are reported from the pyrimidine strand (C or T); for example, a purine mutation like A>C is recorded as its complementary change T>G. This standardization reduces classification to six substitution types: C>A, C>G, C>T, T>A, T>C, and T>G. Considering the nucleotide context—four possible bases at the 5′ position and four at the 3′ position—the classification expands to 4 × 6 × 4 = 96 SBS categories.
